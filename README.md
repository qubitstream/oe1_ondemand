# oe1_ondemand
Python script for downloading, converting and tagging Radio Österreich 1 (Ö1)
broadcasts.

**NOTE**: since April 27th, 2017, Ö1 changed the underlying architecture
(and since May 1th, the programming is different), so this version of the
script will not work anymore.

**Compatible new version**:
[oe1_get](https://github.com/qubitstream/oe1_get)
